#  BookHub SQL Assignment

##  Overview

This project is a beginner-level SQL assignment simulating the operations of an online bookstore â€” **BookHub**. It involves setting up the database schema, inserting data, and writing SQL queries to extract insights.

---

## Database Schema

The database consists of four tables:

- **Authors**
- **Books**
- **Customers**
- **Orders**

These tables represent a normalized structure to track book inventory, customers, and purchases.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and use the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE assignment;
   USE assignment;

2. Run the provided SQL setup script:
        mysql -u username -p < assignment.sql

This will create and populate the database with sample data.

# SQL Query Solutions

GROUP BY B.BookID, B.Title
HAVING COUNT(O.BookID) > 1;
