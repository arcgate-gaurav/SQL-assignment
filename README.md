## 👨‍💻 Assignment Title: SQL Mock Test for Beginners  
**Duration:** 1 Day  
**Case Study:** Online Bookstore – *BookHub*

## 📄 Overview

This project simulates a real-world case study involving a fictional online bookstore named **BookHub**. I have created a relational schema, inserted sample data, and wrote queries to extract business insights.

## 🏗️ Database Design

The database consists of the following four core tables:

1. **Authors** – Contains information about book authors.
2. **Books** – Holds details of all books available for sale.
3. **Customers** – Stores customer registration details.
4. **Orders** – Tracks customer purchases and related data.

The SQL file includes:
- `CREATE TABLE` statements with foreign key constraints
- `INSERT INTO` statements to populate each table with sample records
- `SQL Queries` which I used to complete the assignment
